Introduction to Customer Churn Prediction
Customer churn prediction is a critical aspect of business analytics that focuses on identifying customers who are likely to discontinue using a service or product. This process is essential for companies, especially in competitive markets, as retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. By leveraging supervised machine learning techniques, businesses can analyze historical customer data to predict future churn and implement strategies to enhance customer retention.

Understanding the Churn Rate
The churn rate quantifies the percentage of customers who stop using a companyâ€™s services during a specific period.
